# WordSkull
A word game website project based on Wordle.

I'm using Remix with Vite, Tailwind CSS, Express, PostgreSQL, Digital Ocean for Hosting, Cloudflare CDN, Cloudflare R2, Vitest (for unit, component, & integration testing), Selenium w/ Python for End-to-end testing (will be adding this soon), and more!

This project is still in development but can be viewed live on [WordSkull](https://www.wordskull.com/).

## How To Use

1. **Getting started**: 
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file of the project and extract it to your local machine.

2. **Setup**: 
   - Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Run the development server**: 
   - Start the development server to view the application locally:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - The server should start, and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port depending on your setup).

4. **Build for deployment**: 
   - When you're ready to deploy the application, build the optimized production version with:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - This will generate static files in the `dist` or `build` folder (depending on the setup), which can be deployed to your hosting service.

5. **Testing**: 
   - Run the test suite to ensure everything is working as expected:
     ```bash
     npm test
     ```
   - This will run all the tests defined in the project.
